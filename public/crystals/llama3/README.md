# Llama 3 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Decoder-Only Transformer (Llama 3.2)
**Shape:** The Dense Swarm
**Concept:** Compressed Knowledge

Llama 3 represents a shift towards "dense" intelligence. Unlike the tall, spiraling towers of GPT-2, Llama 3's structure appears more tightly interlinked, representing its high parameter density and efficiency.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure_layers.ply`**: (Real Weights) The true topology of Llama 3.2-1B.
    *   **Colors**: Mapped to layer depth.
    *   **Form**: A compact, highly-connected lattice.

### 2. Significance
Llama 3 is the first model in our gallery to represent the "Modern Open Weights" era, where state-of-the-art capability is accessible to everyone.
