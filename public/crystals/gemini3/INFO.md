# THE OMNI MIND

**Architecture:** Gemini 3.0 (Mock)
**Shape:** The Weaver
**Concept:** Native Multimodality

Gemini 3.0 represents the dream of a single model that sees, hears, and speaks natively.
Unlike CLIP (which has two separate towers), Gemini is natively multimodal from the start.

The crystal visualizes this **Fusion**.
You can see different "textures" in the layers:
*   **Dense Blocks:** Text processing
*   **Wave Patterns:** Audio features
*   **Sparse Patches:** Visual features

**Use Cases:**
*   **Real-Time Voice Assistant:** Conversing with zero latency and full emotional understanding.
*   **Video Understanding:** Watching a movie and answering questions about the plot or visual details.
*   **Universal Interface:** Interacting with the world through any medium (text, voice, image) interchangeably.
