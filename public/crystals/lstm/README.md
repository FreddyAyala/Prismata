# LSTM Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Recurrent Neural Network
**Shape:** The Memory Cell
**Concept:** Gated Flow

LSTMs are defined by their "loops"—information flows back into the network. This creates a spiraling, feedback-heavy structure in the crystal visualization.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure.ply`**: (Simulated)
    *   **Features**: Distinct "Gating" modules (Forget, Input, Output gates) visible as clusters around the central cell state.
