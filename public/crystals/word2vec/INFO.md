# THE ALCHEMY OF WORDS

**Architecture:** Word2Vec (Skip-gram)
**Shape:** The Prism
**Concept:** Vector Space

Before Word2Vec (2013), computers treated words as random strings. "Dog" and "Puppy" were as unrelated as "Dog" and "Microwave".
Tomas Mikolov (Google) changed everything by mapping words to vectors in a dense space.

The crystal visualizes this **Transformation**.
It shows the projection from a massive vocabulary (10,000 words) into a tight, dense 300-dimensional meaning space.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Analogies:** Solving "King - Man + Woman = ?" (Answer: Queen).
*   **Recommendation Systems:** "Users who liked X also liked Y" (Item2Vec).
*   **Search Relevance:** Matching "Cheap hotel" query to "Budget accommodation" result.
