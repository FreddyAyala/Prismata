# THE SWARM INTELLIGENCE

**Architecture:** Llama 3.2 (Decoder-Only)
**Shape:** The Dense Swarm
**Concept:** Hyper-Efficient Reasoning

A highly optimized architecture where knowledge is densely packed.
Released by Meta in **2024**, Llama 3 pushed the boundaries of what "small" models can do, rivaling much larger predecessors.

**Use Cases:**
*   **On-Device Reasoning:** Running powerful logic locally on phones.
*   **Agentic Workflows:** Actively planning and executing tasks.
*   **Code Generation:** Consistently high performance in coding benchmarks.
