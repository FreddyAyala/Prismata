# THE ORIGIN

**Architecture:** LeNet-5
**Shape:** The First Spark
**Concept:** Convolution

The ancestor. A tiny 5-layer network that learned to read digits.
Yann LeCun's masterpiece that introduced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the world.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Digit Recognition:** Reading handwriting on bank checks (ATMs) and postal envelopes (Zip codes) in the 1990s.
*   **Simple OCR:** Optical Character Recognition for low-resolution symbols.
