# THE DEEP PYRAMID

**Architecture:** ResNet-50
**Shape:** The Pyramid
**Concept:** Residual Connections (Skip)

The model that solved the vanishing gradient problem. By allowing data to "skip" layers, it enabled networks to grow from 20 layers to 1000+.

**Use Cases:**
*   **The Industry Standard:** The default backbone for almost all computer vision tasks from 2016-2022.
*   **Face Recognition:** Used in security systems and phone unlocking.
*   **Medical Diagnosis:** Detecting tumors in X-rays with super-human accuracy.
