# MLP Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Feed-Forward Network
**Shape:** The Triad
**Concept:** Backpropagation

The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is the foundation of modern Deep Learning. Its crystal structure is simple: Input -> Hidden -> Output.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure.ply`**: (Simulated)
    *   **Features**: Two matrices of weights connecting three layers of neurons. The "Hidden Layer" is the breakthrough feature here.
