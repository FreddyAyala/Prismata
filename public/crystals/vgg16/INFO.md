# THE DEEP TOWER

**Architecture:** VGG-16
**Shape:** The Monolith
**Concept:** Uniformity

VGG (2014) represents the era of "Just Add More Layers."
Before VGG, architectures were messy. VGG standardized everything: 3x3 convolutions, stacked on top of each other.

The crystal is a massive, solid tower. It represents the brute force approach that dominated vision before ResNet's skip connections made infinite depth possible.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Style Transfer:** Its feature maps are excellent at capturing artistic "style" independent of content.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Often used as a robust, albeit heavy, backbone for object detection.
