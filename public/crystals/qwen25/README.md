# Qwen 2.5 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Qwen 2.5 (1.5B Instruct)
**Shape:** The Logic Engine
**Concept:** Structured Reasoning

Qwen 2.5's crystal structure reveals a highly organized internal state, characteristic of models fine-tuned heavily on code and logic data.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure_layers.ply`**: (Real Weights) The physical topology of the 1.5B model.
    *   **Features**: distinct stratification of layers, suggesting specialized processing zones for logic vs. language.

### 2. Activations
*   **`activation_cot.ply`**: *Input: "Let's think step by step"*
    *   Shows the "Chain of Thought" pathway lighting up, a specific circuit used for sequential reasoning.
