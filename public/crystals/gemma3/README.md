# Gemma 3 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Native Multimodal Transformer
**Shape:** The Triple Helix
**Concept:** Interwoven Modalities

Gemma 3 is unique. It doesn't just process text; it weaves vision and audio tensors directly into the main processing flow. This creates a distinctive "braided" or "helix-like" structure in the weight topology.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure_layers.ply`**: (Real Weights) The signature of Gemma 3.
    *   **Structure**: Notice the repeating 3-phase patterns in the layers, corresponding to the modality interleaving.
    *   **Color**: Cyan (Vision) / Magenta (Audio) / Yellow (Text) biases are visible in the projection.

### 2. Historical Context
Gemma 3 ended the "Modality Gap" era, proving that a single network could master all human senses without bolt-on adapters.
