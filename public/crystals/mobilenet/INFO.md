# THE EFFICIENT WEB

**Architecture:** MobileNetV2
**Shape:** The Spider Web
**Concept:** Depthwise Separable Convolutions

Before 2017, deep learning was heavy. MobileNet proved you could have "Intelligence on a Chip" by splitting convolutions into lightweight depthwise steps.

The crystal appears incredibly sparse, almost like a skeleton. This is by design.
It represents the **Efficiency Revolution** that allows AI to run on the phone you are holding right now.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Video Calls:** Powering the "Background Blur" effect in Zoom/Teams.
*   **Smart Cameras:** Real-time object tracking in security cameras and drones.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Face filters on Snapchat/TikTok.
