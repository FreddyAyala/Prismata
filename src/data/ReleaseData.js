    isNew: true,
    features: [
      "**LIVE KERNEL INTERFACE**: Integrated a real-time neural inference engine (LaMini-Flan-T5). Prismata no longer just displays static archives; it now *thinks*. The gallery has awakened.",
      "**SEMANTIC RESONANCE**: The crystal structure now physically reacts to the *meaning* of your thoughts. Projecting your prompts into 3D space, we identify a 'Concept Coordinate' and pulse the neural lattice at that exact location during generation.",
      "**NEURAL STREAMING**: Implemented a retro-futuristic typewriter interface for real-time thought observation. Watch the AI's internal monologue decode token by token.",
      "**MOBILE DOCK SYSTEM**: A complete paradigm shift for mobile navigation. We've buried the complexity in a sleek, bottom-aligned dock, maximizing the view of the neural artifacts."

      "**INTERACTIVE NARRATIVE**: A guided audio-visual odyssey through the history of Synthetic Intelligence. From the single-layer Perceptrons of 1957 to the trillion-parameter Giants of today.",
      "**SONIFICATION ENGINE**: We now translate neural weights into sound waves. Listen to the unique 'voice' of each architecture, generated procedurally from its mathematical topology.",
      "**THE WEAVER**: A theoretical visualization of Gemini 3.0, representing the future of native multimodal fusion—where vision, text, and code become one."

      "**WAVE SYSTEM**: Implemented a progressive difficulty system with distinct enemy types (Imp, Shotgunner) and boss encounters.",
      "**PERFORMANCE**: Optimized particle systems and collision detection for smooth mobile gameplay."
