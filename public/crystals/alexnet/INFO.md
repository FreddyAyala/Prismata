# THE DEEP LEARNING SPARK

**Architecture:** AlexNet
**Shape:** The Deep Stack
**Concept:** Convolutional Neural Networks

The network that started the Deep Learning revolution in 2012.
Winning ImageNet by a massive margin, it proved that deep convolutional networks could learn features from data.

The crystal shows the classic 5 convolutional layers, growing deeper and capturing hierarchical features.
