# Kimi k2 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Long-Context Dense Transformer
**Shape:** The Railgun
**Concept:** Infinite Attention

Kimi k2 is designed for the "Long Context" era. Its weights are structured to minimize entropy loss over massive sequence lengths.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure_layers.ply`**: (Simulated) A visualization of the "Context Rail" architecture.
    *   **Feature**: A strong central spine (The Rail) surrounded by flexible attention heads.
    *   **Meaning**: The spine represents the preserved context, while the outer shell processes the current token.

### 2. Note on Simulation
Due to the proprietary FP8 format and massive size of Kimi k2, this crystal is a **High-Fidelity Architectural Simulation**, mathematically reconstructed from the published paper's topology.
