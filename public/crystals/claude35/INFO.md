# THE ARTIFACT

**Architecture:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Simulated)
**Shape:** The Aligned Cube
**Concept:** Constitutional Steerability

"The Artifact" represents the highly structured, safe, and "steerable" nature of Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Unlike the "wild" raw weights of open models, Claude is shaped by **Constitutional AI**—a process that aligns the model to rigorous safety and helpfulness standards.

**Visual Signature:**
*   **The Box/Shield:** The simulation creates a rigid outer logical structure, representing the safety guardrails and the "Artifact" UI window.
*   **High Definition:** 3.5 Sonnet is known for its precision in coding and reasoning, represented by the dense clustering of nodes.
