# THE NETWORK IN NETWORK

**Year:** 2014
**Architecture:** GoogLeNet (Inception-v1)
**Shape:** The Lattice
**Concept:** Width & Branching

While VGG went deeper, Inception went wider.
It introduced the "Inception Module": running multiple convolutions (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) in parallel and concatenating the results.

The crystal visualizes this **Branching Complexity**. Instead of a simple tower, the lattice handles multiple spatial frequencies simultaneously.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Efficient Classification:** Achieving high accuracy with far fewer parameters than VGG.
*   **Fine-Grained Recognition:** Good at identifying objects at different scales (e.g., small lesions in Medical Imaging).
