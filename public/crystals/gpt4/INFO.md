# THE COLOSSUS

**Architecture:** GPT-4 (Mock)
**Shape:** The Massive Helix
**Concept:** Mixture of Experts (MoE)

GPT-4 represents a jump in scale and complexity that is hard to comprehend.
While its exact architecture is proprietary, it is widely understood to be a massive Mixture of Experts (MoE) system (~1.8 Trillion parameters).

The crystal visualizes this **Scale**. It is a towering, dense structure that dwarfs previous models.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Advanced Reasoning:** Passing Bar Exams, Medical Licensing Exams, and solving complex logic puzzles.
*   **Coding:** Writing, debugging, and refactoring entire software modules.
*   **Data Analysis:** Interpreting complex CSVs and charts in seconds.
