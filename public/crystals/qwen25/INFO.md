# THE LOGIC CORE

**Architecture:** Qwen 2.5 (CoT Decoder)
**Shape:** The Logic Core
**Concept:** Chain of Thought

Modern models don't just predict the next token; they plan. By generating intermediate reasoning steps ("Let's think step by step"), they navigate complex logic puzzles.
Released in late **2024**, proving smaller, well-trained models could beat larger legacy giants.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Math & Logic:** Solving complex algebra and calculus word problems.
*   **Agentic Workflows:** Breaking down high-level goals ("Plan a trip") into actionable API steps.
*   **Coding:** Generating robust, error-free code snippets.
