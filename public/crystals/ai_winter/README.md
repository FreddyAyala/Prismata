# AI Winter Visualization

**Era:** 1974 - 1980
**Shape:** Connectivity Void
**Concept:** Funding Freeze

This visualization is unique in the gallery. It does not represent a model, but a **lack** of models. It visualizes the sparsely connected, isolated research nodes that survived the funding cuts of the 1970s.

## Visualizations

*   **`structure.ply`**: (Simulated)
