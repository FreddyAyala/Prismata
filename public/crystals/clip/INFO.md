# THE MULTIMODAL BRIDGE

**Architecture:** CLIP (Vision Transformer + Text Transformer)
**Shape:** The Twin Towers
**Concept:** Vision-Language Alignment

Prior to CLIP (2021), AI was either "Blind" (Text-only) or "Mute" (Image-only). 
CLIP bridged these worlds by training two separate encoders to map images and text to the same mathematical point.

The crystal structure reveals two distinct "towers":
1.  **Vision Tower:** Processes pure pixels.
2.  **Text Tower:** Processes pure language.
3.  **The Convergence:** At the very top, they meet.

This "Zero-Shot" capability powered the revolution in generative art (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion).
