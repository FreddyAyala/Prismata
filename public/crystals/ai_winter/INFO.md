# THE VOID

**Era:** The AI Winter (1974-1980)
**Shape:** Shattered Fragments
**Concept:** Stagnation

A period where funding dried up and hope was lost.
Represented not by a crystal, but by **fragments** of broken theories floating in a void.

**Significance:**
It reminds us that progress is not linear. Great ideas can lie dormant for decades (like Backpropagation) before they are rediscovered.
