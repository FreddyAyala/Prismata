# THE HIDDEN LAYER

**Architecture:** Multi-Layer Perceptron
**Shape:** The Triad
**Concept:** Non-Linearity

The moment AI became "Deep".
By adding a single **Hidden Layer**, neural networks could finally solve XOR and other non-linear problems.
Popluarized in **1986** by Hinton et al.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Universal Approximation:** Theoretically capable of learning any function.
*   **Classification:** Simple decision making.
