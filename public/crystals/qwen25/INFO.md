**Architecture:** CoT Decoder (Dense)\n**Shape:** The "Logic Core"\n**Concept:** Chain of Thought\n\nModern models don't just predict the next token; they plan. By generating intermediate reasoning steps ("Let's think step by step"), they navigate complex logic puzzles that baffled early ancestors.\n\n### History\nReleased in late **2024**, the Qwen 2.5 series proved that smaller, well-trained models could beat 5x larger giants.
