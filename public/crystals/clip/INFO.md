# THE MULTIMODAL BRIDGE

**Architecture:** CLIP (ViT + Transformer)
**Shape:** The Twin Towers
**Concept:** Vision-Language Alignment

Prior to CLIP (2021), AI was either "Blind" (Text-only) or "Mute" (Image-only). 
CLIP bridged these worlds by training two separate encoders to map images and text to the same mathematical point.

The crystal structure reveals two distinct "towers" (Vision & Text) converging at the top.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Generative Art:** Guiding Stable Diffusion/Midjourney to generate images from text prompts.
*   **Visual Search:** searching your photo library by concept ("Dog on beach") without tags.
*   **Content Moderation:** Filtering unsafe images by describing them in text.
