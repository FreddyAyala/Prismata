# Phi 3.5 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Phi 3.5 Mini
**Shape:** The Micro-Core
**Concept:** Synthetic Density

Phi 3.5's crystal structure is remarkably dense for its size. This density reflects the "Textbook Quality" data it was trained on—every parameter is doing work.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure_layers.ply`**: (Real Weights) The topology of the 3.8B model.
    *   **Features**: Uniform density, lacking the "fluff" of larger, less optimized models.
