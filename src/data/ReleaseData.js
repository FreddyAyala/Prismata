      "**LIVE KERNEL INTERFACE**: Integrated a real-time neural inference engine (LaMini-Flan-T5). Prismata no longer just displays static archives; it now *thinks*. The gallery has awakened.",
      "**SEMANTIC RESONANCE**: The crystal structure now physically reacts to the *meaning* of your thoughts. Projecting your prompts into 3D space, we identify a 'Concept Coordinate' and pulse the neural lattice at that exact location during generation.",
      "**NEURAL STREAMING**: Implemented a retro-futuristic typewriter interface for real-time thought observation. Watch the AI's internal monologue decode token by token.",
      "**MOBILE DOCK SYSTEM**: A complete paradigm shift for mobile navigation. We've buried the complexity in a sleek, bottom-aligned dock, maximizing the view of the neural artifacts."
