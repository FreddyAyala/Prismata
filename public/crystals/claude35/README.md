# Claude 3.5 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Sparse MoE / Dense Decoder (Proprietary)
**Shape:** The Artifact
**Concept:** Engineered Safety

Since Anthropic does not release raw weights for Claude, this crystal is a **High-Fidelity Simulation** based on the concept of "The Artifact"—Claude's ability to generate structured, self-contained content (code, svgs, documents).

## Visualization Logic

### 1. The Structure (`structure_layers.ply`)
*   **Topology**: Simulated 50-layer depth with "Corner Biasing".
*   **The "Box" Effect**: The simulation biases the weights towards the corners of the projection matrix. This creates a "cuboid" or "shield" like appearance in 3D space, symbolizing the **Constitutional AI** guardrails that box in the model's behavior to be safe and helpful.
*   **Colors**: Represents the flow from Input (Yellow/Red) to Deep Reasoning (Cyan/Magenta).

### 2. Why Simulation?
*   Prismata prioritizes **Real Weights**.
*   However, for closed-source models that are culturally significant (like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5), we use **Algorithmic Art** to represent them in the gallery, ensuring the timeline is complete.
