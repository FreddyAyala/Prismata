# Qwen 3 Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Qwen 3 (8B)
**Shape:** The Omni-Reasoning Lattice
**Concept:** Recursive Logic

Qwen 3 builds upon the "Logic Engine" structure of Qwen 2.5 but introduces recursive feedback loops within its weight topology, allowing for single-pass reflection.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure_layers.ply`**: (Real Weights) The advanced structure of Qwen 3.
    *   **Note**: This crystal was generated from the actual `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` weights.
    *   **Details**: High-density clusters represent the "Reflective" modules interspersed throughout the network.
