# DCGAN Crystal Collection

**Architecture:** Generative Adversarial Network
**Shape:** The Adversaries
**Concept:** Creative Friction

The structure of a GAN is unique: it is two distinct networks locked in a zero-sum game. The crystal visualization attempts to show this duality—two structural poles pulling against each other.

## Visualizations

### 1. Structural Crystals
*   **`structure.ply`**: (Simulated) A high-fidelity reconstruction of the classic DCGAN architecture.
    *   **Features/Layers**: 4 Transposed Convolution layers (Generator) vs 4 Convolution layers (Discriminator).
